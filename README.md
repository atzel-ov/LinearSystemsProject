Lonitudinal dynamics of an aircraft project.

This project contains 4 MATLAB scripts for analyzing a 4th order non-linear system, linearized about its equilibrium point.

PART A :
Finding eigenvalues, simulating the time response and determing stability, observability and controllability.

PART B:
Designing a Full-State-Feedback controller using pole placement and using the Linear Quadratic Regulator method for optimization.
Designing a Luenberger state observer with pole placement.
Combining the above to design a full state feedback controller based on observer.
